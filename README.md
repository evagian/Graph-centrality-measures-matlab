## Social Network Analysis Assignment

Co-Authorship Network Analytics Using MatLab

Founded in Athens during 2002, ICMB developed to the major international research conference on mobile business with a significant number of researchers and authors contributing state of the art scientific papers in academia. This assignment aims at examining the state of the ICMB co-authorship network from 2002 to 2013 by applying Social Network Analysis techniques and measures. Your analysis will be based on the data files that are contained within the CoAuthorshipNetwork folder (which is available to download from the course’s e-learning portal) focusing primarily on developing MatLab code for computing fundamental network component-related centrality measures such as:

## I.	Closeness Centrality

## II.	Betweenness Centrality

## III.	Eccentricity Centrality

## IV.	Eigenvector Centrality.

Develop appropriate MatLab functions and scripts to address the previously described co-authorship network-analytic related issues in the following manner:

a)	You should provide code that reports the top N authors according to each one of the aforementioned centrality measures (Questions: I - IV) for each network component in descending order.

Note: All necessary data files and are included within the CoAuthorshipNetwork folder. Data file “authors.mat” contains information concerning the author_id, author_surname and author_firstname per author. Data files “ICMB-2002.mat” to “ICMB-2013.mat” contain information about the number of papers that have been co-authored by a particular pair of author ids at a certain year. You may use all of the supplied code which was thoroughly explained during the laboratory lectures.
